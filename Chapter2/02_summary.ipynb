    "<h3>Summary</h3>\n",
    "Chapter 2 of \"Tiny Python Projects\" explores string manipulation techniques and introduces the concept of positional arguments. It emphasizes test-driven development and the use of a makefile for organizing commands. The chapter covers f-strings, which allow dynamic output generation based on inputs. It introduces the REPL for interactive code evaluation and debugging. The importance of understanding string types and assigning variables correctly is highlighted. String methods like str.upper() and str.isupper() are discussed. The chapter emphasizes default values for variables and the use of if/else statements. The program's purpose is to print an \"Ahoy\" message with \"a\" or \"an\" depending on the argument's starting character. The solution involves user input, article determination, and message printing. Overall, the chapter provides practical insights for efficient string handling in Python."
